<a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a><br />
<u>CSS-Tricks is a blogsite dedicated to articles on CSS.</u><br /><br />
I'm not much for simply reading articles. Usually, I better integrate what I learn by doing it.<br />
However, CSS-Tricks offers professional articles from real web developers, and as beginner,<br />
it's advisable to listen to the advice of more experienced individuals.<br />
<br /> I think one of the most important parts in the process of learning isn't memorization, <br />
but simply knowing that something exists. I can't remember the syntax of every command in CSS, <br />
but I can remember what to look up in order to find it again.
<br /><br />Because of that, it's beneficial simply learn that something exists, even if you don't have a use for<br />
it yet. I think CSS-Tricks is great for that. Simply read an article or two a day and, over time,<br />
your knowledge of what is and isn't possible will accumulate.

  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a><br />
  <u>Stack Overflow is an online forum dedicated to debugging code.</u><br /><br />
  It's a classic. Any time spent past five minutes of coding will have you needing to Google things.<br />
  And anyone who's spent past five minutes Googling their code issues will stumble upon a Stack <br />Overflow post on it.
  <br /><br /> It's hard to say you've ever truly programmed if you haven't at least once needed to scour
  <br /> obscure Stack Overflow posts, melting your brain onto the screen trying to understand
  <br /> the esoteric nerd-speak of geeks who far surpass you.
  <br />
  <br /> It's a classic, but of course, as any classic does, it gets scrutinized over the years.
  <br /> Common complains have to do with lack of accessibility, and outright hostility by answerers.
  <br /> Newcomers to coding naturally have to learn what their forebearers already know by heart.
  <br /> <br />And so because of that, there is a LOT of repetition, which ends up irritating
  <br /> the volunteers who take the time out of their day to answer questions.
  <br /> It ends up that Stack Overflow is a harsh, but vital resource for the programmer.

    <a href="https://dev.to/">Dev.to</a><br />
    <u>A social site for web developers.</u><br /><br />
    Even for the stereotypically solitary programmer, networking is important.
    <br /> Programming is a vast discipline, and web design not much less than it.
    <br /> Due to that, a coder's best resource is often a second eye.
    <br /><br /> Dev.to serves as a social site for developers. It aesthetically takes after Slack,
    <br /> yet functionally serves like a midway between Reddit and a news article's comments section.
    <br /> Not my favorite look, and there's horrendous margins wasted on the sides, but for a
    <br /> social site, it looks and works well enough.
    <br />
    <br /> Of course, sites aren't really made by their makers, they're made by their users.
    <br /> And Dev.to offers plenty of people to connect with (over a million, in fact).
    <br /> And as a developer-specific site, all of its content and moderation are tailored to it.

      <a href="https://templated.co/">Templated.co</a><br />
      <u>Templates for CSS and HTML</u><br /><br />
      CSS and HTML have been around for decades, and in that time similar designs
      <br /> have been redone many times. In programming, it's best not to reinvent
      <br /> the wheel if it's already somewhere out there. And especially for those
      <br /> less experienced, it's best to work with designs made by experts.
      <br /><br /> Templated.co offers ready-made designs to be used, speeding up the
      <br /> process of creating many of the necessary widgets and functionality found
      <br /> on most sites.

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a><br />
        <u>An excellent resource for tutorial videos</u><br /><br />
        Anytime I'm learning a new programming language, I'll watch an introductory video
        <br /> on it. Any time I'm learning a new data structure, I'll watch an introductory
        <br /> video on it.
        <br /> <br /> Youtube is an excellent resource for finding tutorial videos and introductory
        <br /> explanations for concepts. You could pay for a class, but why do so when there's
        <br /> so many free videos that already exist?
